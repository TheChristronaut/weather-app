This is a tmplate for my current (April 24) preffered web dev environment.

I am using Parcel as my package handler, eslint and prettier for formatting and styling.

I am also using VS Code as my text editor with the approprate extensions installed.

Must run npm install in the terminal at the root of your new project to install package.json dependencies.
